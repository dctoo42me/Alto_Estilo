    <p>Santos always takes care of me and my son! Great barber overall. The best in Harlingen area! If you‚Äôre looking for an experienced barber and respectful, Santos is that barber! <span>Armando L.</span></p>
    <p>My son has been going to Santos for months already. He is 14, and is very picky about who cuts his hair. This past weekend Santos was full and i told my son i can try to find another place , he said nope he wants Santos, so we made an appointment for a later open date. Starting to think i should make appointments 3 weeks in advance for now on. Thank you Santos. <span>Crystal R.</span></p>

    <p>Santos was great with my 6 yr old son while he worked on his first hair design. He was patient & very attentive with him and the results came out perfect, my son loved it! Thank you so much, we will be returning for future haircuts. üíàüôÇ <span>Joanna V.</span></p>
    <p>I recently visited Santos AltoEstilo Barbershop and was impressed by Santos's professionalism and outstanding skill as a barber. His friendliness creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere, and he takes the time to understand exactly what hairstyle you're looking for while ensuring you leave his chair looking and feeling your best. Operating on an appointment-only basis guarantees a personalized and tailored service. I highly recommend Santos AltoEstilo Barbershop to anyone searching for a passionate barber who genuinely cares about his clients. Whether you need a classic haircut, a fresh new style, or a relaxing shave, Santos has you covered. Don't hesitate to book an appointment - you won't be disappointed!<span>JONATHAN C.</span></p>
